# Cheats for Widelands

[Widelands](https://wl.widelands.org) is a real-time strategy video game and a really great remake of one of my all time favourite game series The Settlers/Die Siedler, which was initially released in 1993. Building your empire and watching its citizen performing their tasks is almost a form of meditation. I played this game the other day and had a great session until the other tribes started, wave after wave, to tear down by defence towers. Being a sore loser this called for some retaliation, which came in form of a cheat script. Widelands incorporates the Lua scripting engine and therefore allows substantial modifications.
