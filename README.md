# Cheats for Widelands

[Widelands](https://wl.widelands.org) is a real-time strategy video game and a really great remake of one of my all time favourite game series The Settlers/Die Siedler, which was initially released in 1993. Building your empire and watching its citizen performing their tasks is almost a form of meditation. I played this game the other day and had a great session until the other tribes started, wave after wave, to tear down my defence towers. Being a sore loser, this called for some retaliation, which came in form of a cheat script. Widelands incorporates the [Lua](http://www.lua.org) scripting engine and therefore allows substantial modifications.

## Prequesites

Please note that this cheat script only works with debug builds and not the official release version. Tests have been perform with build version 19. Please refer to the Widelands documentation for further information: https://wl.widelands.org/wiki/BuildingWidelands

## Installation

Copy the file 'cheats.lua' into the Widelands directory.

## Usage and Effect

- Start a single player game and press the `F6` key to bring up the scripting console. Enter `dofile('cheats.lua')` in the console and press enter to load the cheat script.
- Enter `cheat()` into the console and press enter to execute the cheat. Each time you do this, all your warehouses will be stocked up to the brim with wares and well trained soldiers.
